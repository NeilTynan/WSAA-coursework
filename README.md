## About this Project

This repository contains my weekly assignments for ATU module 8640 -- WEB SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS. It contains the project work and assignements for the course.

## Use of this Project

This repository may be of some interest to other students engaged in similar projects around programming and scripting. Feel free to use whatever you like from it (though if another party has been referenced, I would ask that you likewise cite them).

## Getting Started

The workbook is structured in a linear fashion, so reading through it from start to finish is the best approach.

To understand how the workbook has developped to date, please see below a timeline of the work done on the notebook and the material referenced in the course of this work:

- 15/01/2025 - Created ReadMe and Gitignore file as per course materials for 24-25: 8645 -- COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE: w02v03_create_your_repository. Gitignore file generated using the template at Python gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore, the Windows gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Windows.gitignore, the MacOS gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/macOS.gitignore and the Linux gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Linux.gitignore.
- 17/01/2025 - Added folders: "assignments" and "labs"
- 07/02/2025 - Created "assignment2-carddraw.py", in line with assignement 2. External material referenced: https://itman.in/en/how-to-add-parameters-to-the-url-string-in-python/ (how to automatically add the deck id to the api), https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/loop-through-a-json-array-in-python/ (how to use a loop to import data from a JSON object), https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-for-loops/ (how use a loop)
- 19/02/2025 - Continued work on assignement 2. Moved work from "assignment2-carddraw.py" to "assignment2-carddraw.ipynb" as this proved easier to work in. Renamed certain variables in the code for readability purposes for the authors benefit. Added in code for checking if there is a pair, triple or flush. External materials referenced include: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.Counter (counting hashable objects), check if two values in a set are the same python (checking if all values in a list are the same) and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58091242/checking-if-theres-two-pairs-in-card-hand-python (code not used but pointed the author towards the Counter dictionary).
- 23/02/2025 - Created "assignment3-cso.py", as per assignement 3. As part of this assignement, assignment3-cso.py also created "cso.json".Course material referenced: "WSAA4.4 cso practical". Additionally, added in folders for the weekly assignments (so that "assignment3-cso.py" and its output could live together). Completed assigment 2 using counter.items method. External material referenced: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-counter-items-counter-keys-and-counter-values/ (counter.items)
- Course material referenced: "WSAA5.1 Authentication". External material referenced: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28 (REST API endpoints), https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json (getting response data in a json format), https://thelinuxcode.com/python-string-replace-an-in-depth-guide-to-substring-substitution/ (how to use .replace) and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52510584/http-put-request-in-python-using-json-data (issuing a put request with json data). Copilot referenced in relation to how format the commit message that goes with the put request (Prompt "The following code is attempting to replace the all instances of the word "andrew" with the word "neil" in a private repository. Please demonstrate some code to add a commit message to the put request"). The response provided a template for the commit message code and pointed out some errors in the request.put statement.
